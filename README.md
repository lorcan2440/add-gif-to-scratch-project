# add-gif-to-scratch-project
Adds a GIF to a Scratch project as a sprite. The costumes of the sprite will be the frames of the GIF, in the same order and at the original size.

This isn't particularly useful as the editor allows you to add a GIF at once anyway - but it's an example of how to use Python to automate the creation of a Scratch project.
